      <h1>What is Tres?</h1>
      <p>
        Tres is a framework for developing JavaScript applications, with a focus on mobile phones
        and tablets. It's built on top of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="video">
      <h1>Video Demo</h1>
      <p>
        Anagen is a sample application built using Tres, which is included in the source code.

    <section id="install">
      <h1>Installation</h1>
      <p>
        Downloads are <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/tres/downloads">hosted on GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the zip file, you'll find <code>tres.js</code> along with it's dependencies in the
        <code>js/</code> folder. Make sure you include all of those in your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Base styles and the default theme can be found in the <code>css/</code> folder also in
        the zip file. You don't need to use the default theme of course, though I highly recommend
        you include <code>css/tres/base.css</code> at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        A packaging system as well as a development environment is underway. This will get
        considerably easier then.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="how-to-use">
      <h1>How to use</h1>
      <p>The simplest Tres app looks like this:</p>
      <pre><code>class HomeScreen extends Tres.Screen
  template : _.template('&lt;h1&gt;Hello there&lt;/h1&gt;')

$ ->
  App = new Tres.App
  App.on '' : new HomeScreen

  App.boot()</code></pre>
    <p>
      The workflow follows much of this recipe: subclass from <code>Tres.Screen</code>,
      declare a template which holds the markup for a screen, and optionally define what
      happens in a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tres provides a few classes for making common patterns easy to implement.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section id="cookbook">
      <h1>The cookbook</h1>
      <p>
        I'll keep a list of recipes for developing using Tres here. Check back regularly
        for updates.
      </p>
      <section id="general">
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p class="question">Q: How do I make a Tres app?</p>
        <p>
          A: First, follow the instructions from the <a href="#install">install section</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can write a simple app following the recipe right at the start of the
          <a href="#how-to-use">how to use</a> section. The idea is this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>class Home extends Tres.Screen
class About extends Tres.Screen

$ ->
  App = new Tres.App
  App.on
    ''        : new Home   # Home URL
    '/about'  : new About  # About page URL</code></pre>
      <p>
        The method <code>App.on</code> takes an object, which is used to map URLs to
        the screen objects your app has.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="tres-screen">
        <h2>Tres.Screen</h2>
        <p class="question">Q: How do I navigate to another screen?</p>
        <p>
          A: add a regular &lt;a&gt; tag to it's URL. Tres screen objects will automatically
          bind links you add in a screen's template.
        </p>
        <p>For instance:</p>
        <pre><code>class Home extends Tres.Screen
  template : _.template('&lt;a href="about"&gt;Go to about&lt;a/&gt;')
class About extends Tres.Screen

$ ->
  App = new Tres.App
  App.on
    ''      : new Home
    'about' : new About

  App.boot()</code></pre>
      <p>Tapping the link on that page will have the app transition to the About screen.</p>
